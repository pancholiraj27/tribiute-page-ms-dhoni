        <p>
          Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as M. S. Dhoni) is an Indian
          cricketer who captained the Indian team in limited-overs formats from
          2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. An attacking
          right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely
          regarded as one of the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He
          made his One Day International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against
          Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.

          <strong>December 23, 2004:</strong> Makes his ODI debut against
          Bangladesh in Chittagong. Is run out for 0 after facing one ball, in a
          match India win by 11 runs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>April 5, 2005:</strong> The first ODI hundred by an Indian
          wicketkeeper. After scores of 0, 12, 7* and 3, Dhoni is sent up the
          order to No 3 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam and proceeds to smash
          148 off 123 balls with 15 fours and four sixes, setting the platform
          for India's 356/9. The world wakes up to Dhoni's potential.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>October 31, 2005:</strong> Dhoni stamps himself into the
          history books with a record 183* against Sri Lanka in Jaipur, helping
          India chase 301 with six wickets and 23 deliveries to spare. Batting
          at No 3, his 145-ball hundred makes a stiff target look well short and
          India go up 3-0 in the best-of-seven series.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>September 13, 2007:</strong> Dhoni's first international match
          in charge of India is a wash out against Scotland in their ICC World

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>September 24, 2007:</strong> India win the inaugural World
          Twenty20 by beating Pakistan in an absolute humdinger in Johannesburg.

          cricket is changed forever.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>October 2, 2007:</strong> In the next match in Kochi, Dhoni
          scores his first fifty as captain - 58 off 88 balls - as India are
          beaten by 84 runs to fall behind 0-1 in the seven-match series.

        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>March 4, 2008:</strong> A momentous occasion for India as they

          <strong>February 24, 2010:</strong> India win a three-match series at

        <li>
